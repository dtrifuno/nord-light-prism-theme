# Nord Light Prism Theme

An unofficial theme for the [Prism.js syntax highlighting library](https://prismjs.com/) based on the [Nord Light VS Code theme](https://github.com/huytd/vscode-nord-light).

## Usage

To use the theme, copy the `prism-nord-light.css` file and include it on your page as you would any other CSS file. For example,
you can add

```html
<link href="style/prism-nord-light.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

to the `<head>` section of your HTML, or,

```css
@import "/style/prism-nord-light.css";
```

in your main CSS file.
